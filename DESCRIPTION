Description: ISODATA stands for Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis 
              Techniques. This script includes an algorithm which 
              automatically creates groups of data (clusters) by means of 
              an iterative process. During the process, similar
              clusters are merged and those with large standard deviations 
              are split. 
              The centroids of the clusters are randomly selected. Then,
              the euclidean distance among the centroids and the SD of the 
              euclidean distance among each point of the cluster and its 
              centroid are calculated. These two parameters are used to 
              establish if some conditions defined by the user are reached 
              and, therefore, the process of clustering is finished.
